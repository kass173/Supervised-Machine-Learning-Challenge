# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Challenge

This task requires me to be a member of a lending services companies to allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell 
notes backing the loans on a secondary market.

I used the data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, I will be comparing the Logistic 
Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.
