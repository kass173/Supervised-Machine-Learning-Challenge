# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Challenge

That Task is by lending services companies to allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans 
on a secondary market.

I used the data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, I will be comparing the Logistic 
Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.
